# Shrinkage-methods-application-using-R

The aim of this project is to demonstrate the usage of shrinkage methods on a regression dataset and compare the results of application of linear regression vs regularization models.
Scope:
Perform data analysis on a regression dataset along with modelling using Linear regression, Lasso(L1) and Ridge(L2) techniques and explain the results .

The data comes from US economic time series data available from
